# TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2024

## Objective

The **Advent of Cyber 2024** was a hands-on, 24-day cybersecurity challenge hosted by TryHackMe, designed to improve practical skills in various domains of cybersecurity. 

Throughout the event, I engaged in daily tasks that provided real-world experience in areas such as:

- **Penetration Testing**  
- **Network Security**  
- **Malware Analysis**  
- **Incident Response**  
- **Digital Forensics**  

Each day focused on specific cybersecurity concepts and tools, allowing me to explore and apply a wide range of techniques to solve complex security challenges.
